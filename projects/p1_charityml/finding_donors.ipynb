    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. "

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes is used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). \n",
    "    - Its strengths include:\n",
    "        - Very fast to train and predict\n",
    "        - Handles high dimensionality well\n",
    "    - Its weaknesses include:\n",
    "        - The model doesn't have a large amount of model flexibility. This means that it is best used when we have a large feature space (more likely to be separable) or a not-too-complex problem.\n",
    "    - Given the ease of developing a NB model, it is a worthwhile classification algorithm to apply at the beginning of a project to get an initial baseline.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **AdaBoost**\n",
    "    - Winning kaggle competitions! Adaboost is considered one of the best 'out-of-the-box' algorithms and is therefore widely used in industry.\n",
    "    - Its strengths include:\n",
    "        - Strong Performance; because each weak learner focuses on the mistakes of its predecessor, AdaBoost is often one of the most performant classification algorithms.\n",
    "    - Its weaknesses include:\n",
    "        - Can be more susceptible than most algorithms to outliers. Each weak learner in an AdaBoost model focuses on the mistakes of its predecessor; these can be large for an outlier and the model can spend significant effort accounting for these.\n",
    "        - Similarly for erroneous or noisy data, the model can overfit to these points.\n",
    "        - Due to the sequential nature of boosting, it can be hard to parallelize.\n",
    "    - Given that AdaBoost is regularly a top-performing binary classification algorithm, it is worthwhile considering for this problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **SVM**\n",
    "    - SVMs are computationally expensive models to train. This can be attritubed to two factors: \n",
    "        - i) they require a long time to fit the model and  \n",
    "        - ii) model performance is strongly dependent on choosing the right value of C; finding this (through gridsearch) can be time-consuming. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Nevertheless, once trained, the model is very memory-light (only depends on the 2 support vectors for prediction) and fast to predict. There are many examples of when this latter behaviour would be a desirable. Consider for example a website where a prediction is required for the user; an SVM would be a good model to apply in this case.\n",
    "    - Some of the strengths of the model have already been touched upon. These are:\n",
    "        - The final classifier takes up little memory.\n",
    "        - The prediciton is very fast.\n",
    "        - Works well in high-dimensional space\n",
    "        - Due to the wide array of kernels, the classifier can perform well even if the data is not linearly separable.\n",
    "    - SVM's weaknesses include:\n",
    "        - Takes a long time to train\n",
    "        - The classifier does not automatically generate probabilities. Should they be required, they can be generated but are computationally expensive. \n",
    "    - An SVM is appropriate for this classification problem because:\n",
    "        - We have high dimensionality\n",
    "        - The relationship between income and all the features values is likely to be non-linear. An SVM with an appropriate kernel should be able to classify data that is not linearly separable."

    "The AdaBoost classifier consists of an ensemble of weak learners, sequentially built to target the weaknesses of its predecessor. Here's how it works:\n",
    "- The first classifier is trained on the original dataset.\n",
    "- The second classifier is trained on a modified version of this original dataset, modified in such a way that the classifier focuses on fixing the mistakes of the first classifier.\n",
    "- The third classifier, all the way through to the nth estimator (a hyperparameter of boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost), does the same, focusing on the mistakes of the second classifier.\n",

    "This sequential learning methodology aggressively targets the mistakes of the classifier, yielding strong performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once all the classifiers in the ensemble have been trained, they are combined together with each model weighted in proportion to its performance. A highly accurate classifier is accorded a high weight, whilst a classifier with no predictive accuracy is assigned a weight of 0. Combining the models in such a way ensures that the best models have the loudest say."

I think the 5 features I chose are still relevant in this regard, but the actual top 5 features are more relevant when predicting a given person's income this year. This slightly different approach to the problem partly explains the difference in the top 5 features I guessed and the actual top 5 features. For example, stocks and investments can make up a sizeable proportion of an individual's income and as such, capital gains' appearance in the top 5 features comes as no surprise."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
